## How to find NSF Grants for People
If you are wondering how to check what sort of funding your professor might have from the National Science Foundation. Let's take Dr. Spencer Pitre at Oklahoma State University an R1 Land Grant Institution as an example.

## Using NSF Site
If we go to NSF's website and go to https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearch.jsp we can look up awards granted. You can typically tell that a site is a legitmate governement website in the US by the TLD (top level domain) of .gov . 

Going there we see

There is a lot we can unpack from the Organization to state but I've found the simplest look up is just typing in the Professors name and searching that. Normally there only a couple of recipients with the same name.

Clicking on the link we can see it's a new grant that is recently awarded, the abstract will tell us what it's about and why it's awarded.

You can also check inactive awards that have already finished and see their outcome like this link
https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1800387&HistoricalAwards=false

Which will show outcomes.

Anyways have fun verifying the transparency of the sciences and snooping on what other academics are up to.
