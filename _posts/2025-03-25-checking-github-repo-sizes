## Intro
Hosting a site on Github can be concerning if you don't know what you are doing. One concern is that Github recommends you keep repos below 1 GiB in storage.
Looking up guides I come across [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11093796) which is exactly what I needed. When I got to my link https://github.com/settings/repositories I see ![this](/assests/img/repo-size.png)

Which tells me the size of the repo this blog is on.

You do have to log into Github first.
