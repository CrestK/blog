Hello, I'm Crest. I studied chemistry and biology at Oklahoma State University for my bachlor's degree. Attending a land grant institution was useful to be able to work in lab, special thanks to Dr. Jimmie Weaver who let me work in his lab and taught me a lot about Organic Chemisty research. Erik Lantz show me how to learn from my mistakes too. At Stillwater I learned how to set up my own servers and got into self-hosting, Ethan Sholley is a great resource if you like newsletters. 

I mainly post because I love that feeling when you have a specific problem and a random blog answers it.
